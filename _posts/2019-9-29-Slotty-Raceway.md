"Slotty Raceway" is a slot car track, quite a big one. There’s more than 30 meters of track spread out over 12 m². It’s based on [Scalextric](http://www.scalextric.com/) Digital and is designed in such a way that if you don’t actively change lanes, then your slot car will have traveled more than 60 meters before it’s back in the same spot.

I started building Slotty Raceway in 2006. In those days it was called “Arbughi Raceway” since I lived in a small old town called [Arboga](https://www.arboga.se/in-english.html). Arbogas original name was “Arbughi” which means “the riverbend”. I had a domain “arbughi.nu” so the name made sense.
Then I started to travel a lot  more for my work, I moved in together with my, then, girlfriend and moved to [Eskilstuna](https://www.eskilstuna.se). Arbughi Raceway was stored at work and my colleagues kept nagging me about when we were supposed to drink beer and drive slot cars. So I assembled the track and started to apply some paint and structure to it. This was its sorry state:

I finally got it painted in the spring of 2007. This is the mode I was in:

> Slotty Raceway is now painted! There’s always one thing more that you can do, but you’ll have to draw the limit somewhere. And after all that time since it was created I just want to get it done! So ambition decreases and some corners are cut… It’s now in a state that’s presentable so we can start to use it…

And in the middle of 2007:

> We had our first drink’n drive two weeks ago. Loud music, beer and Slotty Raceway. 😉

Slotty Raceway was later sold to a man in southern Sweden and I don’t know its whereabouts now.
