title: Hack your Eltra Ultra Electric Scooter - Lock
categories: [ElectricScooter]

The [Eltra Ultra](https://eltrascooter.se/products/ultra){:target="_blank"} Electric Scooter from is very similar to, but not exactly the same as, the Speedway 4 from:

- [Minimotors](https://minimotorscalifornia.com/products/speedway-4-ultimate-urban-scooter){:target="_blank"}
- [Dualtron](https://www.dualtron.gr/en-gb/electric-scooters/speedway-4){:target="_blank"}

There are more spare parts and extra add-ons then you might expect out there.

As with any transportation device you need to adapt it to your needs.

------

Security! The Ultra has no key and no ability to lock it for operation so you need a lock,

I bought the following lock intended for bikes "[S3 1500/15 mm, cykell√•s, Black](https://www.xxl.se/trelock-s3-1500-15-mm-cykellas-black/p/1080450_1_style){:target="_blank"}".

There we're som added bonuses. The holder for the lock was long enough to fit the handle post, and there was a small lid covering the keyhole!

The mount position of the lock holder is carefully selected to allow the handle post to fold without any problems, and to allow the scooter to be carried in the folded position.
