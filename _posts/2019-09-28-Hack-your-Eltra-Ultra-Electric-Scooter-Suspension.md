title: Hack your Eltra Ultra Electric Scooter - Suspension
categories: [ElectricScooters]

The [Eltra Ultra](https://eltrascooter.se/products/ultra){:target="_blank"} Electric Scooter from is very similar to, but not exactly the same as, the Speedway 4 from:

- [Minimotors](https://minimotorscalifornia.com/products/speedway-4-ultimate-urban-scooter){:target="_blank"}
- [Dualtron](https://www.dualtron.gr/en-gb/electric-scooters/speedway-4){:target="_blank"}

There are more spare parts and extra add-ons then you might expect out there.

As with any transportation device you need to adapt it to your needs.

Comfort! When you look at the Ultra i looks as if it has great suspension, which it has, but...

I'm a heavy guy and I had issues with the front suspension. All to often there was a "plonk" sound when there where bumps in the road, going up curbs and so on. When you look closely you see this:

There's not much space between the front mud guard and the aluminum piece that holds the suspension... That's why it "plonks".

If you remove the front mud guard it looks like this:

Ample space for the suspension to travel up and down. Why is it like this? If you look at how the front mud guard is mounted it looks like this:

Do you see the silver spacer "tubes" between the front mud guard and the scooter?

If you can have the front mud guard lower, then the suspension will get more space and work better.

##Step 1

If you look inside the front mud guard there's sharp extrusions from the casting. You don't want these extrusions to damage your tire!

Sand them down:

I used a Dremel tool for this:

Remount the front mud guard using a couple of washers instead:

If this solves your "plonk" problem, then your done!

##Step 2

It didn't solve my "plonk" problem (I'm heavy, remeber?)

I wanted to have the front mud guard mounted directly to the scooter without spacers or washers. In order to this you have to cut of the small rings on the front mud guard mount:

The small ring:

The screws are now too long. You can either get new shorter screws or add a nut to the screw:

And mount it:

The fit between the front mud guard and the tire is now very tight, it might to tight with the tire chafing into the front mud guard. In this case you need to get your heat gun and adjust the front mud guard. You need to use spacers to get the right fit. Then heat the plastic and form it. I used old tubes from the garden:

##Step 3, bonus

While I was at it... (I'm heavy, you know?)

You can gain som extra millimeters travel for the suspension by heating the top of the front mud guard, using a spacer between the front mud guard and the tire, and a spacer between the front mud guard and the aliminum mount plate at the same time.

The result is a flat top and maximum travel for the front suspension.

There's no "plonks" anymore, and it runs as a dream!

I also adjusted the rear suspension according to the manual. The back end of the scooter is now about 3 cm higher, and it runs even better!
